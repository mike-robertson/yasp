Overview
----

* This project aims to provide free, open source, highly detailed match and player statistics for the Dota 2 community.
* Data comes from the WebAPI provided by Valve and fully automated parsing of match replays (.dem files).
* See [here](http://yasp.co/matches/1912366402) for an example of our match analysis (this match may not have the latest features as we're constantly adding new things).

Tech Stack
----
* Web/Microservices: Node.js
* Storage: PostgreSQL/Redis/Cassandra
* Parser: Java (powered by [clarity](https://github.com/skadistats/clarity))

Quickstart
----
* Using Docker will let you run the code in a container with all dependencies properly installed.
* Install Docker: `curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh`
* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/yasp-dota/yasp`
* Go into the directory: `cd yasp`
* Create .env file with required config values in KEY=VALUE format (see config.js for a full listing of options) `cp .env_example .env`
  * `STEAM_API_KEY` You need this in order to access the Steam Web API.  
  * `STEAM_USER, STEAM_PASS` The retriever requires a Steam account in order to fetch replay salts.  We recommend creating a new account for this purpose (you won't be able to log into the account while the retriever is using it).  If you don't care about getting replay salts/downloading replays then you can skip this step.
* Start a new container running the image, and map your local directory into the container: `sudo docker run -v $(pwd):/usr/src/yasp -di --name yasp --net=host yasp/yasp:latest`
* Start the external dependencies in separate containers.
  * `sudo docker run -d --name postgres --net=host postgres:9.5`
  * `sudo docker run -d --name redis --net=host redis:3`
  * (optional) `sudo docker run -d --name cassandra --net=host cassandra:3`
* Initialize Postgres: `sudo docker exec -i postgres psql -U postgres < sql/init.sql`
* Create tables: `sudo docker exec -i postgres psql -U postgres yasp < sql/create_tables.sql`
* Set up Cassandra (optional): `sudo docker exec -i cassandra cqlsh < sql/cassandra.cql`
* Get a terminal into the running container: `sudo docker exec -it yasp bash`
* Build inside the container: `npm run build`
* Start the services you want to run:
  * `pm2 start pm2.json` This starts all the services according to the manifest in the JSON file.
  * `pm2 start svc/web.js --watch` This starts a specific service and watches it for changes.
  * `web,parser,requests,retriever` These are the minimal services for being able to open the site in a browser and request parses by ID (which is a useful end-to-end test).
  * `pm2 logs web` You can use this command to inspect the output of a service.
  * `pm2 delete all` Stop and remove all the services.
* Useful commands
  * `npm run watch`: If you want to make changes to client side JS, you will want to run the watch script in order to automatically rebuild after making changes.
  * `npm test` runs the full test suite.  Use `mocha` for more fine-grained control over the tests you want to run.
  * `node tasks/updateconstants` pulls latest constants data and saves to `json` directory.
* Get some starter data
  * You can request some parses by ID to get some parsed data.  
  * You can also run `scanner` with `ENABLE_INSERT_ALL_MATCHES=1` in your `.env` to get some matches from the API.
* File changes you make outside the container should be automatically mirrored to the container.
* Make some changes and commit them: `git add --all; git commit -m "My first commit!"`
* Submit a pull request.  Wait for it to be reviewed and merged.
* Congratulations!  You're a contributor.
