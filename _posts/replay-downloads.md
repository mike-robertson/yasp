Today we're pushing out a few small changes:

* Our [teamfight analysis](https://yasp.co/matches/2347466447/teamfights#0) now tracks healing. Gone are the days
  Omniknight is ignored in teamfights!
* Replay downloads: Had an amazing game? Want to hold on to it forever? Nothing beats seeing it again for yourself.
  We keep replay URLs for a while after we parse a match. If we have it, we'll link you to it on the match page 
  so that you can download it without having to open up the Dota 2 client. You'll have to decompress the replay
  using decompression software like [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/).

Also, courtesy of community developer [coreymaher](https://github.com/coreymaher):

* Damage Done/Taken totals and kill/death totals are now on their respective match tables.
* A pesky bug where our match analysis would give poor grades when items are repeatedly purchased
 (like a late courier) has been fixed.

One of YASP's greatest strengths is that our code is completely open source! Want to fix something or add a feature?
You can do that! Check out our [Github](https://github.com/yasp-dota/yasp).

Thanks, and happy hunting!
